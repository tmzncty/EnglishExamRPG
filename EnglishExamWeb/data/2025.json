          "The randomised control trial involved hundreds of years pupils -aged nine and ten-at 45 state primary schools that had not been\"previously exposed to RSC pedagogy.\"They were split into target and control groups and asked to write,for example,a message in a bottle as Fordinand after the shipwreck in The Tempest.The target group was given a 30-minute drama-based activity to accompany the passage.",
          "The peer-reviewed results showed that the target group of pupils drew on a wider vocabulary,used words “classed as more sophisticated or rarer”, and wrote at greater length.They also “appear to be more comfortable writing in role.while[control]pupils imagine how they themselves would react to being shipwrecked,[target]children put themselves in the shoes of a library character and express that character's emotion”.",
          "The Time to Act study also found that while control pupils retied on\" desert island cliche's\"such as palm trees,target pupils were \"more expansive giving a broader picture of the sky,the sea and the atmospheric conditions\".",
          "O'Hanlon said she had been most surprised by the “emotional literacy that was evident in the [target]children's writing and that they were “more resilient in their writing,more hopeful”.She added “The emotional understanding was very evident and it is probably related to the [rehearsal room process]where you are used to trying to imagine your way through. The were comfortable in describing different emotional states and part of what you do in drama is put yourself in different shoes”.The study showed the importance of embedding arts in education,she said.",
          "\"But could the results be replicated with any old dramatist?O'Hanlon said more research would be needed but suggested that Shakespeare's use of 20000 words,compared with the everyday 2000 words,gave a \"massive expansion of language into children's lives”,which was combined with children 'using their whole bodies to bring words to life'\"."

          "“The people who are stealing our movies and our television shows and operating piracy sites are not mom and pop operations,\"says Charlie Rivkin,chief  executive  officer  of  the  MPA.\"This  is  organized  crime.\" Rivkin joined the MPA in 2017 after the organization failed five years earlier to build consensus between Hollywood and Silicon Valley to win passage of legislation in Congress aimed at stopping online piracy.In 2017 the  association  formed  the  Alliance   for   Creativity  and  Entertainment (ACE).an enforcement task force of about 100 detectives circling the globe to help local authorities arrest streaming pirates.",
          "ACE says it's helped shrink the number of illegal streaming services in North America to  126,from more than  1,400 in 2018,aided in part by the MPA's support for a 2020 federal law that made large-scale streaming of copyright material a serious crime.",

          "Visit any antiques store and you'll encounter artifacts from the past: photographs,letters,a brochure detailing the Sinclair dinosaur exhibit from the 1964-65 World’s Fair,the ephemera of history.Yet these objects aren't truly  ephemeral,because  they're  still  here,decades,even  centuries  later. Why?Because they're tangible.",
          "Have  you  pondered  the  life  cycle  of  intangible  formats,digital information,given  that  those  who  produce  these  artifacts  seldom  make provision  for  their  long-term  preservation?For  millennia,we’ve  known what we’ve known due to artifacts that have survived,often despite their original creators'neglect.The thing itself is the medium that delivers the information.At the time of creation,no attempts were made at intentional preservation,yet analog materials have a chance of surviving and serving as the historical record that biographers,historians,and novelists rely on. Libraries and archives have traditionally shouldered the responsibility of organization,preservation,and    access     to     information.One     of     S.R. Ranganathan's foundational Laws of Library Science is “Save the time of the  reader.”Thus,librarians  digitize  the  tangible  so  that  researchers  the world over can quickly search and access their holdings.The result is an embarrassment     of     historical     riches,      which     brings     its      own needle-and-haystack problems.",
          "Librarians'innate  altruism  can  act  against  us  when  users  point  to universality of access by holding up a cell phone and saying,\"it's all in here,\"or noting \"I never have to leave my laptop\"as evidence that libraries are less vital for researchers today.Yet how was that universality of access made possible  and,perhaps more  importantly,how  is  it  maintained?Who curates what is preserved?When it comes to born-digital information,the terrifying  answer  can  be:if  not   librarians  and  archivists,then  no   one. Digital information requires a great deal more care than analog.Even when a digital object is preserved,it may only be the carrier that's saved,not the information itself.As technology advances and a format becomes obsolete, the  object  is  useless.Have  you   ever  stared  helplessly   at  a  ZIP   disk, thinking:how  do  I  get  the  files  off this?Without  constant  migration  of digital  assets,a  nightmare   about  the   foreseeable  future  is  what  keeps historians up at night:a historical record that abruptly stops when digital replaces analog.",
          "This  phenomenon  is  frightening  because  it's  pervasive,from  the photos on your phone to the official U.S.federal government publications integral to documenting our republic and informing its electorate.There's also the horror of sheer volume;we are drowning in a sea of unorganized digital information.Digital objects increase exponentially in a way tangible formats  do  not.In  the  1990s,a  family  might  had  a  few  hours  of home movies documenting three generations.My millennial sister has thousands of hours of video from her two-year-old's still brief time on this planet with no  organizational  metadata  (i.e.,it's  unsearchable).So  when  it  comes  to preservation,the situation is akin to bailing that digital sea with a teacup. From a \"historical record\"standpoint,this doesn't even touch on the issue of authentication,which is increasingly important in an era of deep  fakes, manipulation,and after-the-fact revision of primary sources."

          "Peters likes to photograph butterflies in a landscape,celebrating the beauty of their surroundings as well as the insects themselves.His pictures of a Glanville fritillary rising from the sea-pinks beside the chalk cliffs of Compton Bay on the Isle of Wight are particularly glorious.These tale-off shots are even more challenging because they require a wide-angle lens,which means he must be less than 2cm from the butterfly.It's incredibly difficult to get that close to a skittish sun-warmed insect.Unlike some photographers,who \"cheat\"by keeping insects in a fridge to slow them down.Peters refuses to temper with wild butterflies.",
          "Peters'signature shot is a butterfly \"take -off\",showing the multiple wing-beats of one butterfly in one frame as it lifts off from a flower.How does he capture it?    Technology helps.A typical digital SLR camera shoots 20 frames a second.He uses a high-speed OM System which shoots 120 frames a second.",
          "Britain has relatively few butterfly species compared with mainland Europe and 80%are in decline,mostly because intensive chemical farming has reduced many species to tiny fragments of habitat and small nature reserves.Global heating is benefiting some species but others are too isolated to find suitable new habitat,and gardening habits-paving over gardens and using pesticides -aren't helping either. Butterflies may not pollinate as many plants as wild bees and hoverflies, but because British butterflies are the best-studied group of insects in the world.they are an extremely useful indicator of the wider declines in flying insects.",
          "Five years ago,at summer's end,Andrew Fusek Peters was diagnosed with bowel cancer.\"I was waiting for surgery,feeling really ill, sitting in my garden.It was amazing weather and there were painted lady butterflies everywhere,\"he says.\"They were a symbol of fragile life,of hope and defiance,and something appealed to my soul.",
          "That makes it sound easy,and artificial,but Peters insists it is still a massive challenge.He typically takes between 10,000 and 20,000 shots to get one butterfly take-off sequence in focus.At such high shutter speeds, the depth of field is tiny,and as butterflies do hot fly in a straight line they swiftly flutter out of focus.As well as thousands of attempts,it takes patience and field craft to anticipate a butterfly's likely flight-line-and catch it-in focus",
          "so What's the appeal of a long,sweaty day in pursuit of an elusive, fasting-moving wild animal?\"It just feels bloody brilliant,\"says Peters, \"If I've had a full day of good encounters with butterflies,met interesting butterfly people and I've got some good shots,that becomes a vault in my spiritual bank.It's a happy feeling.\"",
          "A children's author and poet who had become a keen amateur photographer,peters watched the butterflies and idly wondered if he could capture them in flight.It swiftly become an obsession as he recovered from a successful operation to remove the cancer.In recent summers,he has travelled the length and breadth of Britain to photograph all 58 native species of butterfly.Now the fruits of those summers have seen published in a beautiful new book.",
          "A butterfly takes off so quickly it is still impossible to react quickly enough to capture that take-off but if he half-presses the shutter, the camera saves the 70 previous frames before the moment he actually takes the picture.\"It's time travel,so I don't miss the moment of take-off,\" he says.After he's captured the butterfly taking off,he layers  10 to 15 frames together in Photoshop."

As a student myself, I often find myself seeking resources beyond our current collection.\n\nI would like to recommend the following books:\n\n*   \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\" by Yuval Noah Harari: This book provides a comprehensive overview of human history and is relevant to various disciplines.\n*   \"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\" by Robert C. Martin: Essential for computer science students and anyone interested in software development.\n*   \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" by Daniel Kahneman: A valuable resource for understanding cognitive biases and decision-making processes.\n\nThese books are highly acclaimed and widely recommended. I believe they would enrich our library's collection and cater to the diverse academic interests of our students. Thank you for considering my suggestions.\n\nSincerely,\nLi Ming",
          "analysis_raw": "This is a sample letter of recommendation for books to a university library. It includes a clear and concise introduction, specific book suggestions with justifications, and a polite closing. The language is formal and appropriate for the context. The writer offers three suggestions across different academic fields for a range of student needs and highlights the value each book offers.",
          "ai_persona_prompt": "Alright, listen up! This letter's decent, but could be sharper. The suggestions are good, but where's the passion? You're recommending books, not ordering printer paper! Add some punch to why THESE books are ESSENTIAL. Ditch the generic 'greatly benefit' and tell me HOW! And Li Ming, sign off with a bit more zest. Show some enthusiasm, or the librarians will think you're just trying to impress your professor."

Generally, there has been a significant increase in the ownership of these goods.\n\nThis chart reflects China's economic development and the improvement of people's living standards. With increasing income, families are now able to afford more durable goods, which were once considered luxuries. This trend highlights the shift in consumption patterns and the growing demand for higher quality of life.\n\nFrom my perspective, while increased consumption can boost the economy, it’s important to maintain a balance. Overconsumption can lead to resource depletion and environmental problems. It's advisable for individuals and families to make rational consumption decisions, prioritizing needs over wants and focusing on sustainable products. Governments and businesses should also promote responsible consumption and environmental awareness to ensure sustainable economic development.",

But it's a tad… vanilla, isn't it? The language is safe, predictable. We need some spice! Instead of just saying 'significant increase,' how about 'meteoric rise'? Instead of 'rational consumption,' try 'mindful acquisition.' And for the love of Shakespeare, ditch 'From my perspective'! It's painfully obvious it's *your* perspective. Own it! Make it snappier, more engaging. This is supposed to grab the reader, not lull them to sleep."
