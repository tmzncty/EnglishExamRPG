          "Paragraph 2: A study found that a \"rehearsal room\" approach to teaching Shakespeare broadened children's vocabulary and the complexity of their writing as well as their emotional literacy. The research shows that the way actors work makes a big difference to the way children use language and also how they think about themselves, Jacqui O'Hanlon of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), who commissioned the study, said.",
          "Paragraph 3: The randomised control trial involved hundreds of year 5 pupils—aged nine and ten—at 45 state primary schools that had not been \"previously exposed to RSC pedagogy\". They were split into target and control groups and asked to write, for example, a message in a bottle as Ferdinand after the shipwreck in The Tempest. The target group was given a 30-minute drama-based activity to accompany the passage.",
          "Paragraph 4: The peer-reviewed results showed that the target group of pupils drew on a wider vocabulary, used words \"classed as more sophisticated or rarer\", and wrote at greater length. They also \"appear to be more comfortable in role...while [control] group imagine how they themselves would react to being shipwrecked, [target] group put themselves in the shoes of a literary character and express that character's emotion\".",
          "Paragraph 5: The Time to Act study also found that while control pupils relied on \"desert island clichés\" such as palm trees, target pupils were \"more expansive [giving] a broader picture of the sky, the sea and the atmospheric conditions\".",
          "Paragraph 6: O'Hanlon said she had been most surprised by the \"emotional literacy that was evident in the [target] children's\" writing and that they were \"more resilient in their writing, more hopeful\". She added: \"The emotional understanding was very evident and it is probably related to the [rehearsal room process] where you are used to imagining your way through. They are comfortable in describing different emotional states and part of what you do is imagine yourself in different shoes.\"",
          "Paragraph 7: Should the results be replicated with any old dramatist? O'Hanlon said more research would be needed but suggested that Shakespeare's use of 20,000 words, compared with the everyday 3,000 words, gave a \"massive expansion of language into children's lives\", which was combined with children \"using their whole bodies to bring words to life\"."

          "Para 1: Ever since taking on Netflix Inc. at its own game, Old Hollywood has struggled to turn a profit in streaming, with the likes of Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+ losing billions of dollars each year, sparking concerns on Wall Street that some services will never be profitable. But the lure remains: winners that use software to rip a film or television show in seconds from legitimate online video platforms and host the titles on their own, illegitimate services, which take in about $2 billion annually from ads and subscriptions.",
          "Para 2: With no video production costs, illegal streaming sites have achieved profit margins approaching 90%, according to the Motion Picture Association (MPA), a trade group representing Hollywood studios that’s working to crack down on the thousands of illegal platforms that have cropped up in recent years.",
          "Para 3: Initially the rise of legitimate online businesses such as Netflix actually helped curb digital piracy, which had largely been based on file uploads. But now piracy involving illegal streaming services as well as file-sharing costs the US economy about $30 billion in lost revenue a year and some 250,000 jobs, estimates the US Chamber of Commerce’s Global Innovation Policy Center. The global impact is about $71 billion annually.",
          "Para 4: The people who are stealing our movies and our television shows and operating piracy sites are not mom-and-pop operations, says Charlie Rivkin, chief executive officer of the MPA. This is organized crime.” Pivkin joined the MPA in 2017 after the organization failed five years earlier to build consensus between Hollywood and Silicon Valley to win passage of legislation in Congress aimed at stopping online piracy. In 2017 the association formed the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), an enforcement task force of about 100 detectives circling the globe to help local authorities arrest streaming pirates.",
          "Para 5: ACE says it’s helped shrink the number of illegal streaming sites in North America to 126, from more than 1,400 in 2018, aided in part by the MPA’s support for a 2020 federal law that made large-scale streaming of copyrighted material a serious crime.",
          "Para 6: Consulting firm Parks Associates predicts that legitimate US streaming services' cumulative loss from piracy since 2022 will reach $11.3 billion in the next two years. While there is some optimism that emerging countermeasures and best practices may see piracy begin to plateau by 2027, there is no consensus among stakeholders as to when it may begin to decline,” says analyst Steve Hawley."

          "Visit any antiques store and you'll encounter artifacts from the past: photographs, letters, a brochure detailing the Sinclair automobile exhibit from the 1964-1965 World's Fair, the ephemera of history. Yet these objects aren't truly ephemeral, because they're still here, decades, even centuries later. Why? Because they're tangible.",
          "Have you pondered the life cycle of intangible formats, digital information, given that those who produce these artifacts seldom make provision for their long-term preservation? For millennia, we've known what we've known due to artifacts that have survived, despite their original creators' neglect. The thing itself is the medium that delivers the information. At the time of creation, no attempts were made at intentional preservation, yet analog materials have a chance of surviving and serving as the historical record that biographers, historians, and novelists rely on.",
          "Libraries and archives have traditionally shouldered the responsibility of organization, preservation, and access to information. One of S.R. Ranganathan's foundational Laws of Library Science is \"Save the time of the reader.\" Thus, librarians digitize the tangible so that researchers the world over can quickly search and access their holdings. The result is an embarrassment of historical riches, which brings its own needle-and-haystack problems.",
          "Librarians' selfless devotion can act against us when users point to universality of access by holding up a cellphone and saying, \"It's all in here\" as evidence that libraries are less vital for researchers today. Yet how was that universality of access made possible and, perhaps more importantly, how is it maintained? Who curates what is preserved? When it comes to born-digital information, the terrifying answer can be: not librarians and archivists, then no one. Digital information requires a great deal more care than analog.",
          "Even when a digital object is preserved, it may only be the carrier that's saved, not the information itself. As technology advances and a format becomes obsolete, the object is useless. Have you ever stared helplessly at a ZIP disk, thinking: how do I get the files off this? Without constant migration of digital assets, a nightmare about the foreseeable future is what keeps historians up at night.",
          "As a librarian whose day job involves around special collections and digital assets, I share the night terrors of historians, and I'd be lying if I said a comprehensive preservation solution currently exists. Yet researchers can take some comfort in the fact that there are a multitude of digital librarians devoted to discovering, organizing, and preserving digital information for researchers current and future. Librarians are uniquely positioned to understand how end users seek and use information. Thus we play an integral role in identifying, preserving, and providing accessibility to digital assets so that, while future researchers may find the digital realm a challenging place to ply their trade, they won't find it an impossible one."

It swiftly became an obsession as he recovered from a successful operation to remove the cancer. In recent summers, he has travelled the length and breadth of Britain to photograph all 58 native species of butterfly in a beautiful new book.",
          "Britain has relatively few butterfly species compared with mainland Europe and 80% are in decline, mostly because intensive chemical farming has reduced many species to tiny fragments of habitat and small nature reserves. Global heating is benefiting some species but others are too isolated to find suitable new habitat, and gardening habits - paving over gardens and using pesticides - aren't helping either. Butterflies are the best-studied group of insects in the world, they are an extremely useful indicator of the wider declines in flying insects.",
          "Peters' signature shot is a butterfly 'take-off showing the multiple wing-beats of one butterfly in one frame as it lifts off from a flower. How does he capture it? Technology helps. A typical digital SLR camera shoots 20 frames a second. He uses a high-speed OM System which shoots 120 frames a second.",

(47) Recent decades have seen science move into a convention where engagement in the subject can only be done through institutions such as a university. Citizen science provides an opportunity for greater public engagement and the democratization of science.",

Anyone can be a citizen scientist, regardless of age, nationality or academic experience. You don't even need any formal training, just an inquisitive mind and the enthusiasm to join one of the thousands of citizen science projects to generate new knowledge and the means to understand a genuine scientific outcome.",
          "(50) Scientists have employed a variety of ways to engage the general public in their research, such as making data analysis into an online game or sample collection into a smartphone application. They've implored scientists to help with bug counting and image categorizing cancer cells, and even identifying distant galaxies.",

A citizen science-based approach can extend the field of vision and include more ideas and different brains to problem-solve and create, making innovation faster and more effective.",
          "The rise of citizen science has grown alongside the rise of do-it-yourself biology laboratories around the world. These groups of people are part of a rapidly expanding biotechnological social movement of citizen scientists and professional scientists seeking to take discovery out of institutions and put it into the hands of anyone with the enthusiasm.",

They pool resources, collaborate, think outside the box, and find solutions and ways around obstacles to explore science for the sake of science without the traditional boundaries of working inside a formal setting.
