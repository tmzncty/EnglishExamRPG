          "Nearly 2,000 years ago,as the Romans began to pull out of Scotland,they left behind  a  curious  treasure:10  tons  of nails,nearly  a  million  of the  things.The  nail hoard was discovered in  1960  in  a  four-metre-deep  pit covered by two metres of gravel.",
          "Why had the Romans buried a million nails?The likely explanation is that the withdrawal was rushed,and they didn’t want the local Caledonians getting their hands on 10 tons of weapon-grade iron.The Romans buried the nails so deep that they would not be discovered for almost two millennia.",
          "Later civilisations would value the skilled blacksmith’s labour in a nail even more than the raw material.As Roma Agrawal explains in her new delightful book Nuts and Bolts,early 17th-century Virginians would sometimes burn down their homes if they were planning to relocate.This was an attempt to recover the valuable nails,which could be reused after sifting the ashes.The idea that one might burn down an entire house just to reclaim the nails underlines how scarce,costly and valuable the simple- seeming technology was.",
          "The price of nails fell by 90%between the late 1700s and mid-1900s,as economist Daniel Sichel points out in a research paper.According to Sichel,although the falling price of nails was driven partly by cheaper iron and cheaper energy,most of the credit goes to nail manufacturers who simply found more efficient ways to turn steel into nails.",
          "Nails themselves have changed over the years,but Sichel studied them because they  haven't  changed  much.Roman  lamps  and  Roman  chariots  are  very  different from LED strips and sports cars,but Roman nails are still clearly nails.It would be absurd to try to track the changing price of sports cars since  1695,but to ask the same question of nails makes perfect sense.",

          "According to Dr Nikhil Chaudhary,an evolutionary anthropologist at Cambridge University,these practices,known as alloparenting,could lead to less anxiety for children and parents.",
          "Dr Annie Swanepoel,a child psychiatrist,believes that there are ways to incorporate them into western life.In Germany,one scheme has paired an old people's home with a nursery.The residents help to look after the children,an arrangement akin to alloparenting.Another measure could be encouraging friendships between children in different school years to mirror the unsupervised mixed-age playgroups in hunter- gatherer communities.",
          "In a paper published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, researchers said that the western nuclear family was a recent invention which broke with evolutionary history.This abrupt shift to an “intensive mothering narrative”, which suggests that mothers should manage childcare alone,was likely to have been harmful.“Such narratives can lead to maternal exhaustion and have dangerous consequences,\"they wrote.",
          "By contrast,in hunter-gatherer societies adults other than the parents can provide almost half of a child's care.One previous study looked at the Efe people of the Democratic Republic of Congo.It found that infants had an average of 14 alloparents a day by the time they were 18 weeks old and were passed between caregivers eight times an hour.",
          "Chaudhary said that parents now had less childcare support from family and social networks than during most of humans'evolutionary history,but introducing additional caregivers could reduce stress and maternal depression,which could have a “knock-on” benefit to a child's wellbeing.An infant born to a hunter-gatherer society could have more than ten caregivers—this contrasts starkly to nursery settings in the UK where regulations call for a ratio of one carer to four children aged two to three",
          "While hunter-gatherer children learnt from observation and imitation in mixed- age playgroups,researchers said that western “instructive teaching”,where pupils are asked to sit still,may contribute to conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Chaudhary said that Britain should explore the possibility that older siblings helping their parents \"might also enhance their own social development\"."

          "The miracle of the Chesapeake Bay lies not in its depths,but in the complexity of its natural construction,the interaction of fresh and saline waters,and the mix of land and water.The shallows provide homes for hundreds of species while storing floodwaters,filtering pollutants from water,and protecting nearby communities from potentially destructive storm surges.",
          "All this was put at great risk late last month,when the U.S.Supreme Court issued a ruling in an Idaho case that provides the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) far less authority to regulate wetlands and waterways.Specifically,a 5-4 majority decided that wetlands protected by the EPA under its Clean Water Act authority must have a“continuous surface connection”to bodies of water.This narrowing of the regulatory scope was a victory for builders,mining operators and other commercial interests often at odds with environmental rules.And it carries“significant repercussions for water quality and flood control throughout the United States,\"as Justice Brett Kavanaugh observed.",
          "In Maryland,the good news is that there are many state laws in place that provide wetlands protections.But that's a very shortsighted view,particularly when it comes to the Chesapeake Bay.The reality is that water,and the pollutants that so often come with it,don't respect state boundaries.The Chesapeake draws from a 64,000-square- mile watershed that extends into Virginia,Pennsylvania,New York,West Virginia, the District of Columbia and Delaware.Will those jurisdictions extend the same protections now denied under Sackett v.EPA?Perhaps some,but all?That seems unlikely.",
          "It is too easy,and misleading,to see such court rulings as merely standing up for the rights of land owners when the consequences can be so dire for their neighbors. And it's a reminder that the EPA's involvement in the Chesapeake Bay Program has long been crucial as the means to transcend the influence of deep-pocketed special interests in neighboring states.Pennsylvania farmers,to use one telling example, aren't thinking about next year's blue crab harvest in Maryland when they decide whether to spread animal waste on their fields,yet the runoff into nearby creeks can have enormous impact downstream.",
          "And so we would call on state lawmakers from Richmond to Albany to consider reviewing their own wetlands protections and see for themselves the enormous stakes involved.We can offer them a visit to Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Dorchester County where bald eagles fly over tidal marshes so shallow you could not paddle a boat across them but teaming with aquatic life.It's worth the scenic drive."

          "The African savanna elephant, also known as the African bush elephant, is distributed across 37 African countries. They move between a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, woodlands, wetlands and agricultural land.(46) They sometimes travel more than sixty miles to find food or water, and are very good at working out where other elephants are—even when they are out of sight. Using tracking devices, researchers have shown that they have \"remarkable spatial acuity.\" When finding their way to waterholes, they headed off in exactly the right direction, on one occasion from a distance of roughly thirty miles. What is more, they almost always seem to choose the nearest waterhole.(47) The researchers are convinced that the elephants always know precisely where they are in relation to all the resources they need, and can therefore take shortcuts, as well as following familiar routes.",
          "Although the cues used by African elephants for long-distance navigation are not yet understood, smell may well play a part.",
          "Elephants are very choosy eaters, but until recently little was known about how they selected their food.(48) One possibility was that they merely used their eyes and tried out the plants they found, but that would probably result in a lot of wasted time and energy, not least because their eyesight is actually not very good.",
          "(49) The volatile chemicals produced by plants can be carried a long way, and they are very characteristic: Each plant or tree has its own particular odor signature. What is more, they can be detected even when they are not actually visible. New research suggests that smell is a crucial factor in guiding elephants—and probably other herbivores—to the best food resources.",
          "The researchers first established what kinds of plant the elephants preferred either to eat or avoid when foraging freely. They then set up a “food station” experiment, in which they gave the elephants a series of choices based only on smell.(50) The experiment showed that elephants may well use smell to identify patches of trees that are good to eat, and secondly to assess the quality of the trees within each patch. Free-ranging elephants presumably also use this information to locate their preferred food.",

This will make your presentation more coherent and engaging. \n\nNext, conduct thorough research on your chosen scientist, emphasizing their key contributions, the impact of their work, and the relevant historical context. Remember to cover both their life and major discoveries.\n\nTo captivate your audience, begin with an intriguing introduction. Consider using anecdotes and visuals to maintain engagement throughout your presentation. \n\nFinally, practice your delivery to ensure fluency and confidence. Good luck with your report!

The bar chart on the right shows an upward trend in the number of parks of a city in recent three years. I think the two pictures reveal city parks play a vital role in promoting physical activity, and that the number of city parks is a crucial aspect of public well-being.\n\nFirstly, city parks offer opportunities for physical exercise, contributing to people's overall health. They serve as venues for recreational activities such as jogging, cycling, and sports, reducing the risk of sedentary lifestyles. Secondly, the presence of green spaces has positive effects on mental health. Parks provide serene environments, offering an escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life. And nature has proven benefits in reducing stress and anxiety, helping to keep a healthier mental state for city residents.\n\nIn my opinion, it is important to build more parks in cities. A higher number of city parks correlates positively with improved physical and mental health for urban populations. Prioritizing the creation of parks in urban planning is not only an investment in environmental sustainability but also an important step towards fostering healthier communities.",

C'mon, give me some oomph! \"Indispensable\" or \"paramount\" would be better. \n\nThe body paragraphs are solid, good points about physical and mental health. But where's the data? Back it up with stats, people! \"Studies show parks reduce stress by X percent.\" Now we're talking. \n\nThe conclusion is blah. \"Important to build more parks\"? We know that! Instead, leave the reader with something to chew on. \"Investing in parks isn't just beautifying the city; it's investing in the health and happiness of its citizens.\" Bam! \n\nOverall: B+. Needs more spice, more data, and a killer ending. Don't be boring!"
